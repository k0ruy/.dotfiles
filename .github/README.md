# .dotfiles

THIS FORK IS A MODIFIED VERSION TO WORK FOR MY NEEDS, I ENCOUNETERD PROBLEMS WHILE INSTALLING WITH THE ORIGINAL SCRIPTS, SO I MODIFIED THEM.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81622310/233985068-9a630612-5d32-4cc0-a2e1-978d5a94856a.png)

The configuration files for my Linux desktop.  Supports Arch based distros using Gnome and/or i3.  Also, currently it assumes you have an Nvidia GPU and Intel CPU.

I mainly use i3, but I also install Gnome for when people do not want to mess around with a tiling WM.  All of the screenshots are for i3 and the gnome configs are very basic.  

> ℹ️ &nbsp; Remember to choose i3 at the login screen.

> ⚠️ &nbsp; These are my personal dotfiles, which means they will continuously change.

# Installation

To install everything, simply copy and paste this into the terminal.

> ℹ️ &nbsp; This script assumes that you have a working Arch installation.

> ⚠️ &nbsp; I still need to properly test this.

```bash
curl https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/tree/main/.scripts/install/setup.sh | bash
reboot
```

# Theme

The theme is based on my Neovim plugin, [nordic.nvim](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/nordic.nvim).  It is a warmer and darker version of the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) color palette.

# Showcase

Some screenshots showing off the desktop and rice, as well as some custom features I wrote.  Everything has to be *just right*.  I am spending 8+ hours a day on this working, so it might as well be a nice experience.

> ⚠️ &nbsp; Some of these are outdated, I will update them at a later stage.

# Key Bindings

A few notes on the bindings:

- Keys combined with the `Super` key are reserved for OS and WM related actions.  
- Arrows and `hjkl` keys are interchangeable.

# Neovim Config

This [config](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim) has a decent amount of work and is basically a fully fledged IDE.  Why didn't I use [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim), [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) or [SpaceVim](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim)?  I like doing things myself.

> ℹ️ &nbsp; I try to keep all of the key bindings in [this file](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/blob/main/.config/nvim/lua/alex/key-bindings.lua).
